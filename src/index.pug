                    h2 User Experience Design
                    h1 I am a Front-end Web Designer specializing in Graphic, UX, and Interaction Design, with an unparalleled dedication to refinement, craftsmanship, and attention to detail.
                    p I am a firm believer in continuous improvement. My current focus in HTML5, CSS3, and knowledge in JS frameworks allow me to streamline my workflows to design, develop, and optimize prototypes from scratch.
                    p The skills and experience acquired in the past must be used accordingly to tackle new challenges. I adapt to these growing requirements, while keeping the client's vision and objectives in mind. I deliver more with less, adapting to today's demanding user requirements and the diminishing human attention span. I design things that are elegant and simple without sacrificing usability. I listen and find new ways to deliver the best, most effective client experience possible.
                    p At the same time, I like to be bold. I like to make a statement.

                        p After years of experience communicating and understanding the needs of different end-users through personas and market research, I began to notice that the most impactful and memorable experiences are accomplished by taking simple, efficient design approaches. Why take the more complicated path when there is a shorter one to reach the destination?
