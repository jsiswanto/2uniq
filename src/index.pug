                                p After years of experience communicating and understanding the needs of different end-users through personas and market research, I began to notice patterns. It came to my realization that the most impactful and memorable experiences are accomplished by taking simple, efficient design approaches. Why take the more complicated path when there is a shorter one to reach the destination?
