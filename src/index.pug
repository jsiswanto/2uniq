                                p Not every designer notices patterns after years of experience communicating and understanding the needs of different end-users. Going through numerous customer personas, journeys, and behaviour, I came to the realization that our attention spans are getting shorter throughout the years. As a result, I follow an approach to create the most impactful and memorable experiences.
                                
                                p My contemporary design philosophy, along with my knowledge in coding, UX, and Interaction Design, allows me to deliver maximum impact to your clients. I have followed this approach to design high-fidelity mockups, UI, e-blasts, banners, and wireframes for clients at Sun Life Financial, DossierView, various tech startups, and BMO Financial Group.
