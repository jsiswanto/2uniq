These e-mails inform regulatory changes and provide tips to strengthen relationships between advisors and their clients. Analytics and feedback including conversion rates were used to design more effective marketing communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recurring design theme was to promote the financial strength and competitive advantage of Sun Life’s Money for Life, a wholistic financial and insurance advice to support every lifestyle and business requirements of individuals, small businesses, and corporations.&lt;/p&gt;" data-fancybox=gal><div class=bg><div class=caption> <h4>Sun Life e-Newsletters</h4><img src="files/expand.svg"></div></div></a></div><div class=item><a id=two href="files/2.png" data-caption="&lt;h4&gt;Sun Life Illustrations UI&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;a class='button' href='files/CII_05282015.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;See the mockups for Sun Critical Illness Insurance&lt;span&gt; (.pdf)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class='button' href='files/CII_Wireframes_Package.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;View the wireframes &lt;span&gt;(.pdf)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Life Illustrations is a tool used for advisors to estimate insurance premiums by product and client data such as age, gender, and insurance coverage. A separate UI was designed for Sun Life’s wealth products, allowing Sun Life advisors to analyze based on asset allocation on different segregated funds and their return based on given market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with the UX and a team of third party developers, months of user testing and feedback was incorporated to continually refine the wireframes and design of the interface for each desktop and Web release. &lt;a href='https://www.sunnet.sunlife.com/SunLifeIllustrations/ProductSelectorAdv' target='_blank'&gt;View the production version here&lt;/a&gt; (you will be taken to the Sun Life Advisor site).&lt;/p&gt;" data-fancybox=gal><div class=bg><div class=caption> <h4>Sun Life Illustrations UI</h4><img src=files/expand.svg></div></div></a></div><div class=item><a id=three href="files/3.png" data-caption="&lt;h4&gt;Sun Life Illustrations reports&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;a class='button' href='files/SLAGIF_10182014_2.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;View a sample report&lt;span&gt; (.pdf)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a click of a button, the Sun Life Illustrations app can automatically generate PDF reports for advisors to present details of their client’s illustrations. My responsibility is to create InDesign mockups of reports for the Sun Life product portfolio (Insurance and Wealth) with feedback from advisors, product owners, the Illustrations team, and the third party vendor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is to ensure all required copy, tables, and diagrams are presented in an easy-to-read, logical, and concise manner, while minimizing printing costs.&lt;/p&gt;" data-fancybox=gal><div class=bg><div class=caption> <h4>Sun Life Illustrations Reports</h4><img src=files/expand.svg></div></div></a></div><div class=item><a id=four href="files/4.png" data-caption="&lt;h4&gt;Sun Life GIF Solutions client statements&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;a class='button' href='files/FOXB_post06162015.pdf' target='_blank'&gt;View a sample statement &lt;span&gt;(.pdf)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was commissioned to design paper statements for clients of Sun Life’s suite of Wealth products. Working in collaboration with advisors, product owners, and IFDS (International Financial Data Services), I ensured tables, diagrams and other design deliverables were up to specifications while minimizing costs. The objective was to make sure clients easily understand their financial standings presented in these paper statements mailed semiannually.&lt;/p&gt;" data-fancybox=gal><div class=bg><div class=caption> <h4>Sun Life GIF Solutions Client Statements</h4><img src=files/expand.svg></div></div></a></div><div class=item><a id=five href="files/5.png" data-caption="&lt;h4&gt;hyperCONNECT&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mockups of an Android OS app, hyperCONNECT by Pravala Networks, were developed to seamlessly and transparently switch data traffic between mobile and WiFi networks on your phone.
